    "Your first task is to define a class Counter for a counter that counts down. When it gets down to 0 and counts down again, it wraps back to a limit, minus 1. For example, if the limit is 60, the counter's value is 0, and it counts down, its next value is 59.\n",

    "### The Counter class must support the following methods:\n",
    "- __init__(self, limit, initial = 0, min_digits = 1) is automatically called by the Counter constructor. The parameters are the counter's limit (60 in the example above), an initial value, and a minimum number of digits (explained below). If the initial value supplied as a parameter is between 0 and limit-1, then that's the counter's initial value. Otherwise, an error message is printed and the counter's initial value is limit-1.\n",
    "- get_value(self) just returns the counter's value, as an int.\n",
    "- __str__(self) returns the counter's value, as a string. If the counter's value would print with fewer than the min_digits parameter supplied to the __init__ method, then the string contains min_digits characters, padded on the left with zeros. For example, if min_digits is 4 and the counter's value is 15, then the __str__ method should return the string 0015. (Hint: you can determine the length of the counter's value as a string (by calling the str function on the counter's value), and then concatenate as many zeros as necessary (the difference between min_digits and the length of this string).)\n",
    "- tick(self) decrements the counter's value, but if the value would go negative, then it becomes limit-1. For example, if the counter's limit is 12 and its current value is 0, then after calling tick, the counter's value should be 11. This method also returns to its caller a boolean value indicating whether it wrapped around, i.e., did the value wrap from 0 back to limit-1. True means that it wrapped, False means that it did not. We'll see below why we want this extra boolean value."

    "Important note about the tick method of the Timer class\n",
    "- Remember that the tick method of Counter not only ticks the Counter down, but it also returns a boolean telling you whether the Counter wrapped. If you call the tick method of Counter on the seconds counter, and this call returns True, then you need to call the tick method on the minutes counter. And if you call the tick method of Counter on the minutes counter, and this call returns True, then you need to call the tick method on the hours counter. What about if you call the tick method of Counter on the hours counter, and this call returns True? It doesn't matter; you don't have to do anything when the hours counter wraps.\n",
    "- Because each call of the tick method of Counter does two thingsâ€”decrements the Counter's value and returns a boolean telling you whether the Counter wrapped--you need exactly one call of tick for each of the three Counter objects each time you tick the Timer.
